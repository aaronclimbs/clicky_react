# Clicky Game [react]

## About This Project

This project was built with React in order to learn more about state management and how to add events and listeners to an app and properly update state in handling those events.

## Built With

- react (v16.9.0)
- react-bootstrap
- underscore (for array shuffling)

## Usage

The idea is to only click on each gif once, but it is difficult as the order shifts around after each click. Both the high score and the current score are kept in state, as well as the current order of the gifs. After a loss, a random message from Archer is displayed.

## Roadmap

I would like to add an api call to get random set of Archer gifs from Giphy on each reload for the next version.
